# RSA.js
**RSA.js** is a javascript RSA algorithim encryption tool, complete with key generation and functions to encrypt, decrypt, encode, and decode strings.
## Installation
This library is built primarily for browser applications. Simply download it [here](https://google.com) or just hotlink to it:
      
    <script src=""></script>
      
Also, RSA.js relies on bigInt.js to generate, compute, and manage massive values for encryption. Keys, encoded strings, and encrypted strings will be represented as Big Integer objects.  Download bigInt.js [here](http://peterolson.github.com/BigInteger.js/BigInteger.min.js) or use the hotlink below:
